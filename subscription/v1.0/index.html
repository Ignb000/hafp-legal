    <h1>Subscription Terms</h1>
    <p class="meta">Version: 1.0.0 • Effective: 2025-10-13 • Locale: en</p>
    <hr />

    <p>
      These Subscription Terms apply when you purchase a subscription to HAFP (the “Service”). They
      work together with our <a href="../../tos/v1.0/">Terms of Service</a> and
      <a href="../../privacy/v1.0/">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Plans, Trials, Pricing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Plans.</strong> We may offer one or more paid plans (e.g., “All Access”). Plan
        features and prices are shown in-app and may change over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Free trial.</strong> If offered, you can use premium features during the trial. When
        the trial ends, your subscription <em>auto-renews</em> unless you cancel at least 24 hours
        before it ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prices.</strong> Prices are shown in your local currency where available. Taxes/VAT
        may apply.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Billing & Renewal</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Store billing.</strong> Purchases and billing are processed by Apple App Store or
        Google Play (managed via RevenueCat). We <em>do not</em> store full payment details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Auto-renew.</strong> Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each period
        until canceled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manage/cancel.</strong> You can manage or cancel anytime in your Apple or Google
        account settings. Deleting the app does not cancel your subscription.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Cancellations, Refunds, Grace</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Effective date.</strong> Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current paid
        period; you retain access until then.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Refunds.</strong> Refunds are handled by Apple or Google under their policies.
        Contact Apple Support or Google Play Support to request a refund.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grace period.</strong> If enabled by the stores, a short grace period (up to ~72
        hours) may apply for failed renewals before access is interrupted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Changes to Plans or Price</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We may change plan features or prices. For auto-renewing subscriptions, the new price will
        apply on the next renewal and you will be notified by the store where required. If you do
        not agree, cancel before renewal.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Promotions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Discounts, coupons, and intro offers are subject to stated terms and may be withdrawn or
        changed prospectively.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Termination by Us</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We may suspend or terminate access for breach, fraud, or risk to the Service. If we
        terminate without cause, we will prorate or credit where required by applicable law or store
        policy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Local Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Nothing here limits mandatory consumer rights in your country. Where store policies
        conflict, the store policies control for billing/refunds.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Contact</h2>
